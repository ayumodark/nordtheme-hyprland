# nordtheme-hyprland
My personal hyprland dotfiles

#### Some important points:
- Everything is consistent with [nordtheme](https://www.nordtheme.com) color pallete.
- Most of these configs are from dotfiles I collected from the internet.
- While using these configs, I will tweak everything to my liking, improving on them and making them better.
